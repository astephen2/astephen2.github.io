# I write code.

I'm a senior at the University of Michigan. I interned at Yelp and now I'm moving out to California to work at Palantir. I built [CoasterQueues](http://www.coasterqueues.com), where I hack around with theme park wait times.

I'm trying to write more. Some tech, some not-tech. It'll be fun.
