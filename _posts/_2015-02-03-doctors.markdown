It's a rite of passge for teenagers to be cajoled by their parents into considering medicine as a career. There's really no better bragging right for a parent than "My child saves lives." After all, it's all about the parents.

I've spent a little too much time lately in hospitals. Hospitals alone are the reason I could never become a doctor.

1. Waiting Music
For such calm music, it's surprisingly aggressive. Be calm or die! Not exactly comforting

2. PA System
I don't know what a Code Blue is, but there was at least four of them throughout the day. Downtown Detroit may be undergoing quarantine. I really don't know.

3. Local Anathestic
Surgery isn't fun. Except when you have to be awake during it. Local anathestic may simplify surgeries immensely and I'm grateful for it. But, it's terrifying when you have to lay down on a table below the lights of heaven.
