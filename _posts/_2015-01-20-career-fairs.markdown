# Career Fairs - Theme Parks without Rides
I gave a talk at school recently about career fairs. Career fairs are the only force in the career world that give college students power. It's not much power - think a grain of sand on a beach. But, it's something.

I personally don't mind career fairs. You get to go around, talk to people, and get free stuff. The talking is pretty much a script with no awkward small talk. I say a pitch, answer a couple generic questions, and then ask a couple of my own. Others seem to loathe these events, which is completely understandable. I'm going to post my notes about career fairs.

## Resumes
In my mind, a resume is the most important part of a career fair. Long after you're done talking, somebody's going to go look at your resume again. It's gossip on the schoolyard and a resume is the only defense. There's dozens of books and websites about the topic. I tried to boil everything I could down into two things.
