It's been a while since I last posted here. Life's been busy. Plus, I insisted on changing this blog about 7 times before I was happy with it. I had some old posts, but they weren't all that great. I'll probably end up changing them up and then slowly reintroducing them. My vision is to make this kind of a techie blog, but also write about anything else that I want to. So expect some really random stuff coming up.
