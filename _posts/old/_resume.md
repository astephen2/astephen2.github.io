I've had pretty good luck with getting internships and job interviews. More than I probably deserve and definitely more than most people get. I'm convinced that a large part of this is how I handle recruiting. I see the whole process as a game, and I'm not afraid to stack the deck. I'm going to start writing a series about a realist's take on dealing with college recruiting.I'm really going to try to cut out the useless stuff that everyone talks about. There's been too many conversations about GPAs,skills, GPAs, padding, and GPAs. Instead, I'm going to try to talk about the grey areas that everybody does, but nobody talks about. These include hiding weaknesses, phrasing lines better, making accomplishments sound better to recruiters, and getting your resume in front of people, not computers. But, then again, I could just be full of crap. Don't count that out.

# Resumes
Resumes. Everybody in college has one. But, I've become convinced that most of them aren't very good. Most people let their accomplishments "talk for themselves," as if they are so impressive that embellishment simply isn't necessary. Others put on useless information and leave off the important stuff. 
Regardless, most people are pretty good about thinking about "resume-padding." Especially in college, it's pretty easy to think of everything as another bullet point on the resume. Techies are no different. The problem doesn't become finding things to put on a resume; it's a matter of making a resume look and sound good. This is a skill that business people seem to have mastered, while the rest of us don't understand as well. Resumes are all about illusion and psychology.

## Strengths
Everybody, myself included, has strengths and weaknesses. The goal of any resume is to highlight the strong stuff and sweep the bad stuff as far off to the side as possible. I've always had a good mental list of my weaknesses - the things that I didn't think helped me out. But, I think a list of strengths can be just as important. It's important to see the whole picture. Everybody who reads your resume is looking at what's on the page and what isn't. Most of the stuff that isn't is so obvious that it's pretty much bigger than everything else on the page.  
So, the first thing to do is to make a list of strengths and weaknesses. This isn't your resume, so don't worry about length, phrasing, or being politically correct. Just make two lists: strengths and weaknesses. I think that these can be grouped into five categories: classes, work, skills, extra-curriculars, and projects. 

### Classes
* *School:* Unfortunately, not all schools are equals. Sometimes, your school name can be a strength. If your program is ranked particularly well (let's not get started on how horrible those rankings are) or if you see a lot of well known companies at your career fairs, it's a strength. This one isn't very important though.
* *GPA:* Check you in-major GPA and your regular GPA. Take the higher of the two. If you have a high GPA, put it down as a strength. If you don't, it's a weakness. Yeah, sorry. I know that's not ideal. We'll fix it soon.
* *Honors:* Have you ever been on the dean's list? Ever? How about an award of any kind? Put them all down. Doesn't matter how brief or if it was a while ago.
* *Classes:* If you've taken some cool classes, put them on the list as strengths. Don't worry about the grades you got in them.
* *TA Jobs:* If you've been a TA, that's probably a strength. If not, don't worry. 
* *Class Projects:* Feel free to make a list of class projects to put as strengths. But, be forewarned. These better be amazing projects and they shouldn't be too plentiful. But, again, this list is just a temporary thing.

### Work
* *Internships:* All internships are strengths. We all know that some internships are glorified "normal people jobs" with a fancy title. That can be fixed.
* *Minimum-Wage Jobs:* These are all about phrasing. They aren't particularly a strength or a weakness unless you've done a lot or have strong feelings on the matter.

### Skills
List them all. List every programming language, framework, and tool. Include git and Linux (list the distros you've used separately). Windows and Office probably aren't important, but put them down anyways. These are all strengths. Don't list vague strengths like "Goal-oriented" or "Organized." These lists are no place for flowery language. If you're unsure, a good rule of thumb is that all skills probably have official organizations or certifications (yes, this can be pretty flawed.)

### Extra-curriculars
* *Leadership:* Strength. Doesn't matter what you actually did.
* *Member:* If the club is exclusive, it's a strength. If it isn't, it's neutral, unless you're heavily involved as a member.
* *Nothing:* Weakness.

### Projects
List every project you've ever done. Every single one. This goes from scripts to full-blown ,designed-and-documented, applications. Every git repo you've made outside of school should be listed on here. Also, you can find a way to turn skills into projects. Love Linux? Turn your dotfile repo into a project. List everything. 

## Sorting the Lists
My lists look like this. */ MY Strength List */ These lists are probably really long. In particular, your strengths list should be really long. Your weakness list is hopefully shorter. Now, it's time to figure out what is going on your resume.

First, let's address the weaknesses. Next to each weakness, write down some way to make it sound better or justify it. We're looking for some way to make sure that a recruiter doesn't notice this weakness from an abscence on your resume. Low GPA? Highlight the fact that you were on the Dean's List that one semester or that you've taken some cool/hard classes. Few extra-curriculars? Maybe remember that you've been too busy working. Ultimately, we're looking for something to draw attention from your weakness. If you can't find something, don't sweat too much, but keep trying to look. Recruiters don't always notice these omissions, but we're trying to be one step ahead of the game.

Now, time to look at those strengths. Look at each group and rank them from 1-5.

At this point, you have two lists. Mine look like these. */ My ranked lists */ These are the basis of a good resume.

## Templates
Time to get all of these into a resume! You have exactly what you're going to put in the resume. Now, it's just time for it to get there. First, it's time for a good template. There's really no need to make your own template. Google is your friend. You're looking for a nice Word template. It has to have all of the following:

* Whitespace: Just enough but not too much. If there's a whole column to the left wasted, it's useless.
* Format: Is it fairly traditional on format? The order of the template doesn't matter. It just has to have sections, where each section has some things with bullet points.
* Fonts: Ignore them. You'll probably end up changing them later.

Find your template and save it as FirstName LastName Resume.doc. Trust me on this one. The name of your resume file makes a difference.
## Putting the Stuff in
Sweetness. You've got a template, you've got a list. Time to combine the two. Group by group, start plugging information in. Format it in a way that you like, but make sure that it doesn't look too dense. Whitespace is good in moderation. Hell, it's necesary in moderation. For education, add things in verbatim. Feel free to add descriptors, but most of the stuff is pretty self-explanatory. For each thing in work, projects, and extra-curriculars, you should probably add some bullet points

### Bullets
So, bullet point 101, super quick. Bullet points should be relatively short (no more than 3/4 of the way to the end of the page) and should make you sound productive. Make them start with a verb. If you used a specific skill, mention the skill. If you can quantitatively say how you made things better, do that. 

So yeah, looks like you're pretty much good!

## Finishing Touches
Here comes the small stuff. Feel free to alter the fonts. Sans serif fonts are great and may help you stand out. Check out Google Web Fonts, but don't go too over the top. I personally use Open Sans. Make sure you have your contact info plus Github. That's about it. Check out my finished resume and compare.
