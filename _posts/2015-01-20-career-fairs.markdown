# Career Fairs - Theme Parks without Rides

I gave a talk at school recently about career fairs. Career fairs are the only force in the career world that give college students power. It's not much power - think a grain of sand on a beach. But, it's something.

I personally don't mind career fairs. You get to go around, talk to people, and get free stuff. The talking is pretty much a script with no awkward small talk. I say a pitch, answer a couple generic questions, and then ask a couple of my own. Others seem to loathe these events, which is completely understandable. I'm going to post my notes about career fairs.

## Resumes
In my mind, a resume is the most important part of a career fair. Long after you're done talking, somebody's going to go look at your resume again. It's gossip on the schoolyard and a resume is the only defense. There's dozens of books and websites about the topic. I tried to boil everything I could down into two things.

### Design
"Looks don't matter," they say. That saying is about as true for resumes as it is for people. You can't be too unattractive, but you can't be a model either. Basically, don't just throw stuff on paper, but don't do too crazy with the design either. If it's on BuzzFeed, it's wrong. If you didn't design it at all, it's wrong. Find a template online. Change the fonts around. Macs have great fonts - Avenir is a personal favorite of mine. Also, check out Google Fonts for some great ones. Look for a popular, easily readable font. I personally like sans-serif fonts, but to each their own. Serif fonts look more professional, but also boring. Sans-serif are easier to read. It might even be worth doing a serif heading and sans-serif everything else.

### Strengths
There's a lot of opinions about resumes out there. Rules about GPAs, good verbs to use, bad words to avoid - people keep trying to make a science out of this. I think it's easier than that. Find out what your strengths are. Emphasize them. Find out what your weaknesses are. Find some good ways to cover them up.

It's definitely easier.

## Career Fairs
Career Fairs aren't about the journey - they're about the destination. This isn't Route 55 and the fun isn't in the trip. Career Fairs are fun only if recruiters are into you. 

### Research
There's a trick I found out about researching companies. You don't have to know much. You don't need to know about their campus or about their board or about their perks or about the "10 Trickiest Questions asked at Company X." You need to know what they do and what kind of tech they do. Guess how long that takes? About 5 minutes. How long is the minimum amount of time one spends standing in line for any particular company?

Yeah, research instead of playing Candy Crush in the Google line. It's really that simple.

### Elevator Pitches
I hate that phrase. Almost as much as I hate the word "networking." It gives me this horrific sensation across my body, as if I'm about to contract hives and the plague all at once. Or, at least, that's what I would imagine contracting those two would feel like.

Just say your name, your degree, what you want, and talk about a cool project/job/thing you've done. Takes about 5 sentences. Hand over your resume and wait. Mission accomplished.
